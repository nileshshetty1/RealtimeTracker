I made a realtime delivery person tracking system using ExpressJs, NodeJs for backend and ejs for the frontend 
and added realtime functionality using Socket.io . also added a marker to pinpoint the exact location of the partner 
which is updated every 5 seconds and the new coordinates are sent to the backend to handle the new coords (Lat,Long).
